# StefansWebsiteAngular
After learning Angular with Nodejs, Express and MySql, I am making my website that was implemented using only front-end and hardcoded data into a multi-tier application with the Front-end in Angular and Nodejs, Express and MySql as backend.

This will be an ongoing project during Summer 2018 and will take my earlier website coded in JavaScript and HTML/CSS and will turn it into a 3 tier architecture consisting of:
1) Front-end: Angular aka HTML/CSS and other frameworks such as Bootstrap
2) Business-logic: Angular aka Typescript/JavaScript
3) Persistence: Node js with Mysql and Express
